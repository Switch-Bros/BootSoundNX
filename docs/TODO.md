# TODO

## 1.5.0

- [ ] Get boot sound to play on boot, for the latest Atmosphere and HOS versions.
- [ ] Test the code more thoroughly.

## Long-Term Goals (Not necessarily going to happen)

- [ ] Add a way to change the boot sound from the homebrew menu (maybe?)
- [ ] Add a better configuration system (maybe?)
- [ ] Make a homebrew configuration app (maybe?)
- [ ] Add a default boot sound, as a fallback for custom bootsounds (maybe?)
