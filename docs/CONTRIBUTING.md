# Contributing to the project

## A brief foreword

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! I really appreciate it! However, there are a few things that I would like to mention before you start contributing to this project.

First, please be aware that I am a college student, and as such, I do not have a lot of time to work on this project. I will try to get to your pull requests as soon as possible, but please be patient with me. I am human, and can only do so much.

Second, please be aware that we have a code of conduct for this project. Please read it before contributing to this project. If you do not follow the code of conduct, you will not be allowed to contribute to this project any further.

Third, please be aware that I am not the original developer/maintainer of this project. That title belongs to [KranKRival](https://github.com/KranKRival). I am merely the current maintainer of this project. Please do not ask me to add features that are not in the original project. If you would like to add features, please fork the project and add them there. If you would like to add features to this project, please add a feature request as outlined below (and preferably some code to go with it, too).

Fourth, and finally, while I am not the original developer, I am trying to make improvements to the original project. That is the purpose (and the reason why I forked the project in the first place). It is also the reason OSS (Open Source Software) exists in the first place. I am open to ideas, contributions, etc., just please be aware of the above points and try to be respectful of my time and the time of others.
